    <p><strong><em>Indian</em></strong> cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional 
        cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. 
        Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, 
        ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use 
        locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits.</p>
        
        <p>Indian cuisine has shaped the history of international relations; the spice
            trade between India and Europe was the primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery.
            Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe and Asia. 
            Indian cuisine has influenced other cuisines across the world.</p>
