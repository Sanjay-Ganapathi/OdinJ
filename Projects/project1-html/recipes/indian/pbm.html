    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Paneer makhani (also called paneer butter masala) is a slightly sweet creamy dish of paneer, originating from the Indian subcontinent, in which the gravy is prepared usually with butter (makhan), tomatoes, cashews or cream. Spices such as red chili powder and garam masala are also used to prepare this gravy.
        A survey found that paneer butter masala was one of the top five foods ordered in India.</p>
